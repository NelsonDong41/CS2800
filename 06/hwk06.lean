the famous _De Morgan's laws_ of propositional logic state that:

  1. ¬ (p ∨ q) is equivalent to (¬ p) ∧ (¬ q) 
  2. ¬ (p ∧ q) is equivalent to (¬ p) ∨ (¬ q) 

thou shalt (you shall) prove these laws. we will first split each equivalence into two implications, so you will first have 4 separate lemmas to prove. try to prove as many of those 4 as you can using only constructive logic, that is, _without_ using classical.em, nor classical.by_contradiction. how many and which ones did you manage to prove without these axioms?
